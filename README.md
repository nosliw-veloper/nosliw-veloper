### Quick notes / troubleshooting

* If a public endpoint still fails, **self-host** a fork of any of the above projects (deploy on Vercel/Render/Railway) and add a `GH_TOKEN` env var with a personal access token — that removes the shared rate-limit problem. See the repos for a step-by-step deploy. ([GitHub][1])

* Want me to:
  • produce a version with a dark/light mode pair, or
  • generate the exact self-host steps (fork → Vercel → GH_TOKEN) for you to follow?
  Pick one and I’ll give the exact commands/URL examples you can paste into GitHub.
